		<p>I am web developer primary working with Ruby on Rails apps.  I feel most comfortable in the application layer, but I also enjoy designing interfaces and writing bash scripts.</p>

		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>My formal education consists of a Computer Information Systems degree from Chapman University in Orange, California (while also playing around with film production, accounting, and business).  I must also give The Internet much due credit for my continued education in all things programming and design.

		<h2>Philosophy</h2>
		<p>There is far too much sh**ty software out there.  On behalf of all programmers everywhere, I apologize to those for whom technology has made their jobs more difficult rather than easier. In our defense, it's not easy to make usable, reliable, maintainable software; to have such an deep understanding of a problem that one is able to create instructions for a computer to carry out the solution. Personally, this challenge is precisely the reason I love to create software.</p>

		<h2>Proficiencies</h2>
		<h3>Front-end</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Javascript</li>
			<li>jQuery</li>
			<li>AngularJS</li>
			<li>CSS</li>
			<li>Sass</li>

			<li>Bootstrap</li>
		</ul>

			<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
			<li>WordPress</li>
			<li>Jekyll</li>
			<li>NodeJS</li>
			<li>Sinatra</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Databases</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>PostgreSQL</li>
			<li>MySQL</li>
			<li>Redis</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Operations</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Linux Servers (Red Hat, CentOS, Ubuntu)</li>
			<li>Passenger</li>
			<li>Puma</li>
			<li>Nginx</li>
			<li>Apache</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Monitoring</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Google Analytics</li>
			<li>New Relic</li>
			<li>Bug Snag</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Continuous Integration</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Capistrano</li>
			<li>TravisCI</li>
			<li>Codeship</li>
			<li>MiniTest</li>
			<li>Rspec</li>
			<li>Capybara</li>
		</ul>

		<p>These are the tools I use most frequently.  However, my philosophy is to use the best tool for the job.  Ultimately what matters is that the user gets the information they need as quickly, efficiently, and delightfully as possible.</p>
