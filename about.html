		<h2>In A Few Words</h2>
		<p>
			I build websites.<br />
			I create apps.<br />
			I write software.<br />
			I grow businesses.<br />
		</p>
		
		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>My formal education consists of a Computer Information Systems degree from Chapman University in Orange, California (while also playing around with film production, accounting, and business).  I must also give The Internet much due credit for my continued education in all things programming and design.

		<h2>Philosophy</h2>
		<p>There is far too much sh**ty software out there.  On behalf of all programmers everywhere, I apologize to all those for whom technology has made their jobs more difficult rather than easier. To our defense, it's not easy to make usable, reliable, maintainable software; to have such an deep understanding of a problem that you are able to create instructions for a computer to carry the solution. But for me, this challenge is precisely the reason I love to software development.

		<p>I strive for my applications to have both intuitive interfaces as well as powerful functionality. I will always take the extra effort to do it the Right way (time permitting) over the easy way.</p>

		<p>Someone said this and I love it, "Design for the end users, develop for the next developer."</p>
		

		<h2>Geeky Stuff</h2>
		<p>I'll go all the way up and down the stack, from linux init scripts to making it look good in IE.</p>

			<li>jQuery</li>

		</ul>

		<h3>Back-end</h3>

			<li>Wordpress</li>
			<li>Jekyll (Fav)</li>

			<li>TravisCI</li>
			<li>Codeship</li>

		</ul>

		<p>These are the tools I use most frequently.  However, my philosophy is to use the best tool for the job.  Ultimately what matters is that the user gets the information they need as quickly, efficiently, and delightfully as possible.</p>
